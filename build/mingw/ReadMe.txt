Procedure to set up the environment:

- get MinGW & MSys from <http://www.mingw.org/> and install it
- get pkg-config (which depends on glib-dev) from <http://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html>

You may need to manually copy the tifiles, ticables & ticalcs pc scripts into MinGw rather
than MSys.
