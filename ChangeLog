SubVersion: $Id$

Set svn:eol property to native on all files
	
To do : 
- key codes for TI8x (check)
//- manage ERR packets which can be received at any time
- macros.h should be endian dependant (configure check ?)
- make dirlist more generic (merge apps & vars)

To do (USB):
- create a linked list of allocated virtual packet and clear/release them on ticalcs_error_get. Same for calcparam
- check sending of FLASH on TI84+/D-BUS (FlashContent.data_length)
- check pbar updating
- s/r backup
- send OS

	TI83+/89/92+ calculator.
	This function is cleaner than ti89_92_92p_isready and should be used 
	as a replacement even if it does not check for a TI92 any longer.

	It was due to a lack of memory so I have added a more explicit message
	for this case
	ti89_waitdata() improved.
	Error codes changed (valued).
	
- 19/12/2001, version 2.1.1:
