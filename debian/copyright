Hi Romain,

I thought that I had released the ROM dumper under an X11 or BSD-type
license.  If that's the case, there shouldn't be any problem using it
with GPL code as far as I'm aware.  In any case, though, you certainly
have my permission to relicense it as GPL or LGPL if you like.

This reminds me, incidentally - I intended quite some time ago to
write a direct USB version of the ROM dumper, but I never got around
to it.  I'll try to finish that sometinme soon, seeing as I actually
own a TI-84+ now. :)
