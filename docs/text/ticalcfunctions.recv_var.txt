[Description]
This function attempts to receive one variable at a time from the calculator 
and place them into a single file (single/group) or a group file.

Depending on the value passed into mode, you can receive:
<br>- a single variable into a single file,
<br>- several variables with a file for each variable,
<br>- several variables into a group file.

Note: the filename parameter is an in/out parameter depending on the request mode. 
When a single variable is received into a single file, the filename is
returned by the function.
When a group file is got, you must supply a filename to store within.
