Definition=char** ticalc_action_action_array (int num_entries);

[Parameters]
num_entries : the number of variables
Returns : the action array

[Summary]
Create an action array to use with @ticalcfunctions.send_var@.

[Description]
The array is a NULL terminated array of strings which contains 'num_entries+1' pointers.
Each pointer is a dynamically allocated fixed-length string.

The string is splitted into 2 parts:
- the first char contains the action. It's pre-initialized with ACT_OVER.
- the others chars contains the new name of the variable (if the variable has to be renamed) or the same name than the target (if the variable has to be overwritten).

<br>Example: 
<br>action(0) = ACT_OVER
<br>action(1) = "varname"
