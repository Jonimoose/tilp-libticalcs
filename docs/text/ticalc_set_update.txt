[Parameters]
iu : the structure to pass to the library
start : called when a transfer is started
stop : called when a transfer is finished
refresh : called to periodically let control to GUI for refresh
pbar : called whenever a progress bar has to be updated
label : called whenver a label has to be updated

[Summary]
Tells library to use our 'update' functions.

[Description]
This function allows the user to place a set of callbacks. These callbacks are usually GUI functions that the library can call.

Note: the pointers must points on valid functions. They can not be NULL.
If you does not want this capability, make the structure points on void functions (see the test_ticables.c program).
