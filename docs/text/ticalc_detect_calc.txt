[Summary]
This function attempts to probe which calculator model is plugged.

[Description]
This function is deprecated because it uses a special and non official algorithm for detecting the calculator model. But, this work with all calculators but may not work with
the SilverLink cable.

About the algorithm: the library send a 'screendump request' packet and wait for a reply.
Depending on the reply and the packet itself, the library may send another packet until a valid answer is received. The answer determines the calculator model.
