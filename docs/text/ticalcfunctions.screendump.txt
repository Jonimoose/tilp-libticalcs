[Parameters]
bitmap : the address of an @uint8_t@ pointer

sc : the image measurements
Returns : 0 if successful, an error code otherwise

[Summary]
Get a screenshot of the calculator screen.

[Description]
This function do a screenshot of the calculator screen. The resulting image is placed in bitmap (a dynamically allocated array) and the image size is placed in sc.

According to the calculator model and the flags, the image is fully copied or can be clipped.

The array can be freed when no longer used. Anyways, the library will free it on the next call. You have to use free for releasing memory (don't use g_free).

Note: this function always works unless the calculator is in the VarLink menu.
