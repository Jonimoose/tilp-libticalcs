Definition=void ticalc_set_cable (@TicableLinkCable@ *lc);

[Parameters]
lc : a link cable structure

[Summary]
Set a link cable to use by the ticalcs library.
Using this function makes the library completely independant of the hardware
protocol (link cable management).

Most of the time, you will pass a TicableLinkCables structure set by the ticables library.
But, you can pass you own structure, too. This is what I have done in the TiEmu
project (http://ti-lpg.org/prj_tiemu, linkport.c): this allowed me to implement direct file loading in a very straightforward fashion !
