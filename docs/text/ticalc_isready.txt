Definition=int ticalc_flash_isready (@TifileCalcType@ *calc_type)

[Parameters]
calc_type : the calculator type is returned here
Returns : 0 if successful, an error code otherwise

[Summary]
This function detects which calculator model is plugged and check whether it's ready.

[Description]
This function is better than @ticalc_detect_calc@ because it uses official commands.
But, this worksonly with FLASH calculators, that is to say TI73, 83+, 89, 92+.
Unfortunately, the V200PLT has the same IDs than the TI92+. Thus, there is no way to dinstinguish them.
